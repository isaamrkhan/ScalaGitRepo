This is the directory for all of the main key concepts we learnt.<br /><br />
In this section we learnt all the basics starting from variables and loops<br />
We also learnt slightly more advanced topics such as an introduction to OOP and 2d arrays<br />
There are also several activities that were completed here to test our knowledge on what we have learnt so far<br /><br />
After this folder we moved onto SBT and continued our porograms there
