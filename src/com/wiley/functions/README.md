In this package we learnt all about different types of functions<br />

First we learnt basic functions and how to define and call them<br />
High-Order functions are functions that take other functions as a parameter<br />
A nested function is when a function is defined in another function<br />
A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its own fuction<br />
Currying is a way to modify an existing function<br />
We can add a default value to a function parameter in case that function is called without a parameter<br />
