In this package we leant how to make use of Arrays<br />
In Scala an array is a fixed size and can only contain variables of the same type<br />

We learnt how to declare arrays in multiple different methods<br />
We were also shown how to loop through an array using a for loop<br />
We were also shown ArrayBuffers so that we have the ability to break out of an array loop<br />
