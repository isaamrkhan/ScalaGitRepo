In this package we leant how to make use of Arrays
In Scala an array is a fixed size and can only contain variables of the same type

We learnt how to declare arrays in multiple different methods
We were also shown how to loop through an array using a for loop
We were also shown ArrayBuffers so that we have the ability to break out of an array loop
