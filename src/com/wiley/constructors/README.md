In this package we learnt about the usage of constructors aand did some activities on them

Primary Constructor - if a rogram only contains one constructor it is called the "Primary Constructor"
Auxilary Constructors - if more constructors need to be added they are called "Auxilary Constructors"
we use the "this" keyword to refer to the current object in the contrucotr. These are vital in auxilary constructors
