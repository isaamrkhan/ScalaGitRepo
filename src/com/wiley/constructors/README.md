In this package we learnt about the usage of constructors aand did some activities on them<br />

Primary Constructor - if a rogram only contains one constructor it is called the "Primary Constructor"<br />
Auxilary Constructors - if more constructors need to be added they are called "Auxilary Constructors"<br />
we use the "this" keyword to refer to the current object in the contrucotr. These are vital in auxilary constructors<br />
