This is my project which compiles all that I have learnt throughout this Scala training course<br /><br />

The project is based around a hero and villain game where you can create each player and interact with their abilities and stats<br />
It contains features loops, user input, sets and also goes into more advanced features such as OOP and inheritance as well as much more
