This is where we started working on our SBT.<br /><br />
We created an SBT project and began to use dependancies to learn more complex programs<br />
we learnt concepts such as major collections, Streams and akka streams and Threading<br />
One major aspect was unit testing which is in the other directory<br /><br />

[My project is located here](https://github.com/isaamrkhan/ScalaGitRepo/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/wiley/characterProject)
